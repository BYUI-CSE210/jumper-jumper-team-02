**To Do**

  **Coding That Needs Done**

      In Director:

        In do_updates:
          add else function at the end of the if block
            This will add one to the parachute's counter
            That should tell the parachute class to remove a line from the drawing

        In do_outputs:

          Add everything!

          Print out the current state of the parachute

          If the parachute's counter is too high, is_playing = False and print the "You lost" message

          If the word is solved, is_playing = False, print the word and the "You won" message


      In Card: (Everything is done I think)


      In Parachute:

        Add everything!

        Attribute: Make a list that has each diagram of the parachute, one line per entry.
        
        Attribute: Make a counter that tracks how many times we've guessed wrong.

        Method: Print as many lines in the diagram as (length of diagram array - counter)
